## [H-1] `TSwapPool::swap` function breaking the entire protocol by doing some random stuff. It should be removed.

## [L-1] In `PoolFactory::createPool` function wrong concatenation of strings has been done.
**Description** In `PoolFactory::createPool` function, wrong concatenation of strings has been done. In `liquidityTokenSymbol` variable we are concatenating `ts` symbol with the `.name()` function which is wrong, we have to use `.symbol()` function instead of `.name()` function.

**Proof of Concept:**
<detials>

```diff
        string memory liquidityTokenSymbol = string.concat(
            "ts",
-            IERC20(tokenAddress).name()
        );

        string memory liquidityTokenSymbol = string.concat(
            "ts",
+            IERC20(tokenAddress).symbol()
        );
```

# Informational
 ## [I-1] PUSH0 is not supported by all chains
 **Description:** Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the  generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a  chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.
 
 **Recommended Mitigation:** Use the appropriate EVM version for your deployment target.

  ## [I-2] In `PoolFactory__PoolDoesNotExist` this custom error is not used anywhere in the contract.
 **Description:** `PoolFactory__PoolDoesNotExist` is not used any any where in the contract it is recommended to remove it. This  will reduce the contract size and gas cost. It wil also make the contract more readable.

  ## [I-3] `PoolFactory::PoolCreated` Event is missing indexed fields.
 **Description** Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note  that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event  (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly  of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

  ## [I-4] In `PoolFactory` contract, constructor is not checking for zero address.
 **Description:** In the constructor of `PoolFactory` contract, it is not checking for zero address. It is recommended to check  for zero address before deploying the contract.

 ## I-5: Large literal values multiples of 10000 can be replaced with scientific notation
**Description**Use `e` notation, for example: `1e18`, instead of its full numeric value.
```diff

+       uint256 private constant MINIMUM_WETH_LIQUIDITY = 1e9;
